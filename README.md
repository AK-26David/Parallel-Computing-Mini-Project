# Image Segmentation using CUDA - Synopsis
## Introduction
Image segmentation is a fundamental task in computer vision and image processing, used
to partition an image into meaningful regions. It plays a crucial role in various applications,
including object detection, medical imaging, and autonomous navigation. Traditional CPU-
based segmentation methods often suffer from high computational costs, making them
unsuitable for real-time applications.
In this project, we aim to leverage CUDA to accelerate color-based image segmentation by
utilizing parallel computing on NVIDIA GPUs. This will significantly enhance execution
speed and enable efficient processing of high-resolution images.
## Objectives
Implement color-based segmentation using one or more techniques:
• Thresholding (basic pixel intensity separation).
• K-means clustering (unsupervised segmentation into clusters).
• Region Growing (segmentation based on pixel neighborhood similarity).
Compare GPU-accelerated segmentation with CPU-based implementations.
Optimize CUDA kernels for memory efficiency and execution speed.
Analyze the performance improvements using execution time comparisons and visual
results.
## Methodology
Preprocessing:
• Load input images.
• Convert images to an appropriate color space.
• Normalize pixel values for efficient processing.
Implementation of Segmentation Algorithms using CUDA:
• Thresholding: Parallelize intensity-based segmentation using simple logical
operations.
• K-means Clustering:
o Randomly initialize cluster centroids.
o Assign pixels to the nearest cluster using parallel distance calculations.
o Recalculate centroids iteratively using parallel reduction.
• Region Growing: Implement an efficient parallel queue-based approach for
segmentation expansion.
## Memory Management:
• Utilize cudaMalloc for memory allocation and cudaMemcpy for data transfers.
• Optimize memory access using shared memory and coalesced memory access
patterns.
## Performance Comparison:
• Run segmentation algorithms on both CPU and GPU.
• Measure execution time and compute speedup factor.
• Analyze results for different image sizes.
## Expected outcomes
• Successful GPU-accelerated image segmentation implementation.
• Significant performance improvements over CPU-based methods.
• Insights into CUDA optimizations for memory and execution efficiency.
• A well-documented comparison of different segmentation approaches.
## Tools & techniques
• Programming Language: C with CUDA
• Libraries: OpenCV for image handling, CUDA Toolkit for GPU computing
• Hardware: NVIDIA GPU-enabled system
• Development Environment: VS Code / NVIDIA Nsight / Jupyter Notebook (for
analysis)
## Conclusion
By completing this project, we will gain hands-on experience in parallel computing with
CUDA and understand how GPU acceleration enhances real-time image segmentation
tasks. This knowledge will be valuable in fields such as medical imaging, autonomous
systems, and AI-based vision applications.
